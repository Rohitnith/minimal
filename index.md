One of the biggest Integrated Oil & Gas Company is having huge annual procurement to the tune of 3.6 Billion Dollars. Huge amount of data generated while procuring these goods & Services can be useful in re-inventing procurement strategies for consolidation, rationalization and optimization of workload for resource efficiency. In this case study Purchase Data has been processed using traditional Unsupervised Learning techniques of Machine Learning taking inspiration from RFM analysis used typically to gauge customer behaviour based on past data. The main task was to work out materials which can be considered for Centralisation of Purchase considering cumulative contract value, frequency and nos. of location where such material is procured.

An Edtech start-up  had a phenomenal seed A funding round. They used this funding to gain significant market share by campaigning aggressively. Due to aggressive campaigns, the amount of junk leads increased. Having junk leads in the pipeline creates a lot of inefficiency in the sales process. Thus the goal  is to build a system that categorizes leads on their propensity to purchase Code pros course. This system will help remove the inefficiency caused by junk leads in the sales process.
Main task is to design a MLOps system using MLFlow and Airflow to effectively implement solution on live data which can effectively tackle problem of Data Drift etc.

Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis. In this project main task was to build a multiclass classification model using a custom convolutional neural network (CNN) which can accurately detect Melanoma among similar other Skin Diseases.

Telecommunication industry, customers tend to change operators if not provided with attractive schemes and offers. It is very important for any telecom operator to prevent the present customers from churning to other operators. Main task in this case study was to build an ML model which can predict if the customer will churn or not in a particular month based on the past data.
